## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Loan Approval Prediction Model** using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to predict whether a loan application will be **approved** or **rejected** based on applicant information such as income, credit history, employment status, and other relevant factors.

The workflow includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis**, **feature engineering**, **handling class imbalance** using techniques like **oversampling** and **SMOTE**, followed by training and evaluating classification models to accurately predict loan status.
