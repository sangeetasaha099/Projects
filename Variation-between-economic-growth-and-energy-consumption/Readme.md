# üìò Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between economic growth and energy consumption across selected Asian countries over the period 1966‚Äì2021. The study distinguishes between periods of high and low GDP growth and examines how these regimes affect energy usage patterns.

## üîç Key Components:
- Time series analysis of GDP and energy consumption growth  
- Stationarity testing using the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test  
- **Autocorrelation and persistence analysis** via **ACF, PACF**, and **Ljung-Box** tests  
- Modeling using **AR/ARMA processes** where applicable  
- Segregated regression models for **high and low GDP growth regimes**  
- Country-wise comparison using **OLS regression**, with hypothesis testing for statistical significance  

The analysis provides insights that can inform energy policy and economic planning, especially for sustainable growth across diverse economies.
