# Time-Series Analysis  
**Analyzing the Impact of Economic Growth on Energy Consumption During High and Low Growth Periods**

## Introduction  
Numerous studies have explored the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. While some argue that GDP growth drives energy usage, others suggest the reverse. Energy consumption encompasses all energy used in production, households, and transportation, measured in units like joules, BTUs, or terawatt-hours. Economic growth is commonly represented by GDP, with real GDP (adjusted for inflation) offering a clearer picture of changes in economic output.

Studies have shown mixed results: some like Cheng (1999) and Ghosh (2002) found GDP affects energy use, while others like Hwang and Gum (1991) observed the opposite. This highlights the importance of context and methodology in analyzing this relationship.

## Motivation  
Despite extensive research, fewer studies have focused on how energy consumption behaves under **different GDP growth regimes**. This paper investigates how **high (above mean)** and **low (below mean)** GDP growth periods affect energy consumption in selected Asian countries, offering insights for policy-making and sustainable development.

## Objective  
To examine the influence of economic growth on energy consumption during high and low growth periods across seven Asian countries, analyzing how different economic phases impact energy usage.

## Data  
The study uses time-series data from **1966 to 2021**, with GDP growth data from **Macrotrends** and energy consumption data from **Our World in Data**, converted to **terawatt-hours**. The sample includes **five developing countries** (India, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Pakistan) and **two developed nations** (Japan, Singapore), allowing for a balanced analysis across different stages of economic development.
